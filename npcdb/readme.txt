NPC database generator for Homunculus/Mercenary AI.

run:
$ sh getnpc.sh

This script will download and generate a npc-list.txt that contains a path for
all basic eAthena's npc scripts. Then it will download and build the npc path and
files from eAthena's repository, parse them and generate a npcdb.lua that you
can use in your AI.
